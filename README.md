Overture is a collection of open-source software used to overcome significant
obstacles in storing, managing, and sharing genome-scale datasets. Overture is
developed and maintained by the Software Engineering team at the Ontario
Institute for Cancer Research (OICR). Our vision is to help research,
healthcare, and patient communities collaborate and advance genomic research by
providing cutting-edge open source software solutions.

- **Genome informatics first:** You can use our solutions for anything, but here
  at Overture we focus on Genome Informatics. With rapidly expanding datasets at
  the heart, we build data platforms to gather, organize, and share genomic data
  in distributed cloud environments.

- **Swappable:** There is no such thing as perfection. Our tools are implemented
  to be interchangeable from the get-go. You can pick-and-choose from our
  software stack and simply use the components that best match your use case.

- **An open world:** We are strong believers in open-source software, open
  science, and open communication. Donâ€™t hesitate to follow our teams activities
  on GitHub, or contact us from our Slack channel.

- **Closing the loop:** Our team has established a strong foundation in building
  software solutions for genomic projects, from data generation and submission
  all the way to dissemination and analysis, leading to a deep understanding of
  the genomic data lifecycle. The Overture stack contains a wide array of
  components for cloud infrastructure, data shepherding, and analysis.

As an open-source project, we are continuously refining our software and are
